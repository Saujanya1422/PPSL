This C++ program demonstrates multilevel inheritance in object-oriented programming.
A base class `Vehicle` is defined, followed by derived classes `FourWheeler` and `Car`.
`FourWheeler` inherits from `Vehicle`, and `Car` inherits from `FourWheeler`.
An object `myCar` of class `Car` is created.
Methods `Car()`, `fourWheeler()`, and `Vehicle()` are called through `myCar`.
The output displays the characteristics of a car: "I am a car", "I have four wheels", and "I am a vehicle".
This program showcases inheritance and polymorphism in C++.
